//: ## Exercise 2.46
//: A two-dimensional vector `v` running from the origin to a point can be represented as a pair consisting of an `x`-coordinate and a `y`-coordinate. Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor make-vect and corresponding selectors `xcor-vect` and `ycor-vect`. In terms of your selectors and constructor, implement procedures `add-vect`, `sub-vect`, and `scale-vect` that perform the operations vector addition, vector subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar.
// See Types.swift

//: ## Exercise 2.47
//: Here are two possible constructors for frames:
//: ```
//: (define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
//:   (list origin edge1 edge2))
//:
//: (define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
//:   (cons origin (cons edge1 edge2)))
//: ```
//: For each constructor supply the appropriate selectors to produce an implementation for frames.
// Skipped because not relevant in Swift.

//: ## Exercise 2.48
//: A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of vectors—the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector representation from Exercise 2.46 to define a representation for segments with a constructor `make-segment` and selectors `start-segment` and `end-segment`.
